That service is the ability to setup and manage 'meetups' of people for a common cause or interest. The price is not that expensive but for a Hackspace just starting out it would be nicer to cut down on costs that are not completly nessisary. \r\n\r\nThat's were this idea came from.\r\n\r\nInstead of using an outsourced group, why didn't we use a home-grown service written and maintained by it's members. This project will hopefully be a replacement for that service.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nThis repo does not contain a couple of files. This means that you cannot clone it fully. Some files contain sensitive information such as access to the database and keys for calendars and the such.
