# CheltHackGatherings
A replacement for meetups.com for Cheltenham Hackspace.

## Origin
As it currently stands (as of 14/06/2015) meetups.com charges for their service. That service is the ability to setup and manage 'meetups' of people for a common cause or interest. The price is not that expensive but for a Hackspace just starting out it would be nicer to cut down on costs that are not completly nessisary. 

That's were this idea came from.

Instead of using an outsourced group, why didn't we use a home-grown service written and maintained by it's members. This project will hopefully be a replacement for that service.
